## Purpose
Hi, and welcome to the .NET Regular Expressions Course!

In just a couple of hours, you will gain precise and relevant information that you can immediately apply to your projects

I am Chandra Lingam, and I am your instructor. 

Here are some typical uses of regular expression

## Data Preparation
Data clean-up and preparation is often one of the most time-consuming activities

You can define the structure of data as a regex pattern and parse data

One good application of this is AWS Glue and Athena.  

You can use regex to define the structure of a record in a text file, and query the file using SQL

## Input Validation
You can implement a client-side check for input validation

For example, your app can guide the user to provide data in the correct format. 

As part of the zero-trust architecture, you need to validate input to your microservice

With regex, you can verify and validate data payloads in your service


## Cloud Services
Several cloud services use regex for advanced configuration. 

With the AWS web application firewall, you can allow or deny traffic based on a regex pattern

In Google Workspace, you can use regex for content filtering, Gmail route configuration, and to search for content in google docs

In Google Analytics, you can use regex to locate and transform matching data in your data set

Regex is also supported by several products such as SAP, Oracle, and SQL Server

## Curriculum
Here is a brief course outline:

In the Regex features section, you will get familiar with various regex methods, their purpose, and how-to unit test your pattern

In the regex language section, you will learn how to write patterns – starting from the simplest of patterns

You will also learn to incorporate regex in your HTML input types for validation

Regex engine puts the onus on the developers, that is us, to write efficient patterns

You will gain knowledge of regular expression engine that will help you write optimal patterns

There are several exercises for you to apply your new skills

We then look at performance and how poorly written patterns can degrade exponentially

How to optimize the patterns and address performance issues

In .NET, there are a few different ways to interact with the regular expression class

You will gain insight into what method is appropriate for a given performance requirement

There are four hands-on projects in this course

You will learn how to apply the regex for distinctly different data sets – unstructured log data, IoT sensor data, and parsing medical test data in HTML format

You will get prompt support through the course Q&A forum and private messaging.

I am looking forward to meeting you
